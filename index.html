                    <h3>Why-coding</h3>
                    <p>In campus i had a couple of ideas but managed to solve & implement a few. The lecture mode of learning made me grasp little code skills. That's where the journey begun learning slowly by own efforts till i joined Moringa School where all i dreamt of came true. I had to quit everything in fibre optics to major in coding. Thats my lane</p>
